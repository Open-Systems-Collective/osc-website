# 🌍 Open Systems Collective (OSC)

Welcome to the **Open Systems Collective (OSC)** —  
an independent, open research community exploring **intelligent, ethical, and adaptive systems**.

---

## 🌱 Vision
The Open Systems Collective is founded on the belief that progress in artificial intelligence, high-performance computing, and ethics should advance **transparently and collaboratively**.  
We aim to build an open ecosystem where researchers, developers, and practitioners can **create, share, and evolve** knowledge without institutional or geographic barriers.

---

## 🧭 Mission
To foster research and development in areas that shape the next generation of intelligent systems:
- **Responsible & Transparent AI**
- **Semantic & Symbolic Reasoning**
- **High-Performance and Distributed Systems**
- **Workflow Mapping and Scheduling**
- **Ethics and Normative Modeling**
- **Compute Continuum and Cognitive Scheduling**

We value openness, reproducibility, and interdisciplinary collaboration.
